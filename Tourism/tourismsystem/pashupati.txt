PASHUPATINATH TEMPLE


Dedicated to Lord Shiva, Pashupatinath is one of the four most important religious sites
in Asia for devotees of Shiva. Built in the 5th century and later renovated by Malla kings, 
the site itself is said to have existed from the beginning of the millennium when a Shiva lingam 
was discovered here.

The largest temple complex in Nepal, it stretches on both sides of the Bagmati River which 
is considered holy by Hindus.  The main pagoda style temple has a gilded roof, four 
sides covered in silver, and wood carvings of the finest quality. Temples dedicated to several 
other Hindu and Buddhist deities surround the temple of Pashupatinath.

Nearby is the temple of Guheshwori dedicated to Shiva's consort Sati Devi. Cremation of 
Hindus take place on raised platforms along the river. Only Hindus are allowed inside the gates 
of the main temple. The inner sanctum has a Shiva lingam and outside sits the largest statue of 
Nandi the bull, the vehicle of Shiva. There are hundreds of Shiva lingam within the compound. 
The big Maha Shivaratri festival in spring attracts hundreds of thousands of devotees from within 
Nepal and from India.
