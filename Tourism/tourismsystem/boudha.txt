BOUDHANATH STUPA


Boudhanath Stupa (or Bodnath Stupa) is the largest stupa in Nepal and the holiest Tibetan Buddhist temple 
outside Tibet. It is the center of Tibetan culture in Kathmandu and rich in Buddhist symbolism. The stupa is 
located in the town of Boudha, on the eastern outskirts of Kathmandu.

History of Boudhanath Stupa

Bodnath was probably built in the 14th century after the Mughal invasions; various interesting legends are told 
regarding the reasons for its construction. After the arrival of thousands of Tibetans following the 1959 Chinese 
invasion, the temple has become one of the most important centers of Tibetan Buddhism. Today it remains an 
important place of pilgrimage and meditation for Tibetan Buddhists and local Nepalis, as well as a popular tourist site.

What to See at Boudhanath Stupa

From above, Bodnath Stupa looks like a giant mandala, or diagram of the Buddhist cosmos. And as in all Tibetan 
mandalas, four of the Dhyani Buddhas mark the cardinal points, with the fifth, Vairocana, enshrined in the center 
(in the white hemisphere of the stupa). The five Buddhas also personify the five elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether), 
which are represented in the stupa's architecture.

There are other symbolic numbers here as well: the nine levels of Boudhanath Stupa represent the mythical Mt. Meru, 
center of the cosmos; and the 13 rings from the base to the pinnacle symbolize the path to enlightenment, or "Bodhi" 
— hence the stupa's name.
